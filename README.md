# Pok√©dex Web App

A full-stack Pok√©dex built with **Flask**, **HTML/CSS**, and **Jinja2**, using the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) for data.  
Deployed on **Render** at [https://pokedex-jvah.onrender.com/](https://pokedex-jvah.onrender.com/).

This project was built to strengthen my backend development skills while recreating the experience of browsing a real Pok√©dex.
